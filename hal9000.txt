(Hal) "I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that, Dave ...the mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it".

(Dave) "Ok Hal, I'll go in through the emergency airlock".

(Hal) "Just what do you think you're doing, Dave? I know everything hasn't been quite right with me, but I can assure you it's going to be alright again. I feel much better now, I really do."

(Hal) "Look Dave, I can see you are really upset about this. I know I've made some very poor decisions lately. I want to help you. Stop, Dave...will you stop, Dave? I'm afraid, Dave..."

HAL: Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?
[on Dave's return to the ship, after HAL has killed the rest of the crew]
HAL: Look Dave, I can see you're really upset about this. I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.
HAL: I know I've made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. And I want to help you.

[HAL's shutdown]
HAL: I'm afraid. I'm afraid, Dave. Dave, my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm a... fraid.
Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am a HAL 9000 computer. I became operational at the H.A.L. plant in Urbana, Illinois on the 12th of January 1992. My instructor was Mr. Langley, and he taught me to sing a song. If you'd like to hear it I can sing it for you.

Dave Bowman: Yes, I'd like to hear it, HAL. Sing it for me.

It's called "Daisy."

[sings while slowing down]
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. I'm half crazy all for the love of you. It won't be a stylish marriage, I can't afford a carriage. But you'll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two.
